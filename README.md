# LearningVanillaJS
To me, the only way to learn how to code, is coding.

Until now, I used to complete tutorials and challenges then saving it all only on my PCâ€¦
A friend suggested me to post everything I did here on Github, but I only find this repository, probably I deleted my history of study when I realized that I learned the subjects LOL


To test it all, you just need to open "index.html" file on each folder

--> CSS is not mine <--
